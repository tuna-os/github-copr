"""The gap closure must walk BuildRequires:, not only runtime Requires:.

The target is a base OS image, so by definition it ships no build-only
packages.  A build tool appears only in BuildRequires: and never in any runtime
dependency, so a closure over Requires: alone cannot see one -- it is not that
the tool is judged present, it is that it is never considered.

Measured against Hummingbird's own index (22335 capabilities) and Fedora's
source index (23166 SRPMs): 413 capabilities the build order needs that nothing
provides, blocking 462 of its 680 packages.  extra-cmake-modules alone blocks
112, kf6-rpm-macros 106, gtk-doc 62.  bison and flex -- 17 each -- are the
tell: ordinary buildroot tools, absent from a base OS precisely because nothing
at runtime needs them.

The PEP-517 backends fixed in #268/#269 were the first instance to reach CI.
They were one case of this class, not a special case, which is why the fix
belongs in the closure rather than in a hand-written bootstrap tier.

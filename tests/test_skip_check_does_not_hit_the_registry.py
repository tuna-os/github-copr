"""The already-built check must not cost a registry round-trip per package.

`check_package_exists` is what makes hummingbird's incremental convergence
work: each run seeds `local-repo-hummingbird/` from R2 and this function is
what decides, per package, whether it is already there and can be skipped.

The decision is cheap. Reaching it was not. It resolved the expected NVR by
starting a container with `--pull=always` against a *fixed* tag
(`ghcr.io/tuna-os/mock-runner:centos-stream-10`), which the workflow has
already pulled once in its own "Pull mock runner" step. So every package paid
a GHCR round-trip -- including every package that was about to be skipped.

That scales the wrong way for tunaos-packages#401. Convergence assumes the
per-run overhead stays flat while the useful work shrinks; here the share of
the ~5h05m usable budget spent confirming "already built, skip" grows as the
seed grows. In the limit -- everything built -- a run still round-trips the
registry once per package to conclude it has nothing to do.

`--pull=missing` keeps the image available without re-resolving the tag, and
is also the more correct choice: the NVR is compared against RPMs an earlier
run built, so answering from a freshly-resolved image is a way to get a
different answer than the one that produced them.

"""The build order was five per-desktop orders glued end to end.

measure-hummingbird-gap.py tiered each desktop separately and the emitter
concatenated the five results, deduplicating as it went. That is not just
longer than it needs to be, it is wrong, and for a reason that is invisible
unless you look at tier_sources: it only draws an edge when the dependency is
in the set being tiered. Each desktop therefore saw a different subgraph, and
an edge to a package another desktop happened to claim simply was not there.

Measured on the 78-tier manifest this produced 993 BuildRequires edges, across
405 of 1248 source packages, whose dependency was built in a LATER tier:

    nautilus         gnome-09  tier 13   BuildRequires desktop-file-utils
    desktop-file-utils                   built in kde-00, tier 14

Those builds did not fail. The buildroot also carries fedora-rawhide, so they
resolved the dependency from Fedora and quietly linked against Fedora's copy
instead of the one this manifest exists to build -- the same class of silent
ABI drift that the fc45/Python-3.15 split produced earlier.

Tiering once over every desktop's packages at the same time gives every edge a
chance to exist. It is also 36 layers instead of 78.

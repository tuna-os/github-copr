"""A renderer-script change must not rebuild every chain end to end.

`scripts/build-chain.sh` and `scripts/parse-build-order.py` are renderer
inputs: an edit to them cannot be attributed to any package, so every
build-chain family gets selected. Until now each of those cells then built its
family's WHOLE chain on the PR gate.

Measured on #576's gate -- a two-line build-chain.sh fix:

    cell                    duration
    xfce-el10-x86_64        51m
    xfce-el10-aarch64       38m
    gnome50/51 el10 x4      >50m, unfinished
    cells selected          36

None of those packages can compile differently because of that diff. The gate
was buying nothing with the hours.

The fix is depth, not breadth. Every family still runs -- only its FIRST tier
does. `hummingbird` already had `canary_tiers: bootstrap-00`; the other
families were simply never given one.

What must stay true, and is asserted below:

  * the nightly, publish legs and fan-out never pass canary_common, so they
    still build everything;
  * a cell whose OWN manifest or sources moved is never bounded -- a spec
    change must build the real thing;
  * every family survives the bounding (see the canary_cells collapse hazard
    in test_every_family_survives_the_bounding);
  * every declared canary tier NAMES A REAL TIER -- a typo would build zero
    packages and pass vacuously, which is worse than the slow gate.

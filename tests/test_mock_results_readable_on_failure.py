"""The container step must hand /builddir back to root on EVERY exit path.

scripts/build-chain.sh runs mock inside a podman container as an unprivileged
`builder` user, over a bind-mounted host directory.  Everything mock writes is
therefore builder-owned, and the HOST process -- the plain CI runner user,
outside the container entirely -- cannot read it through the mount.  The
container has to chown the tree back before it exits.

That restore used to be a plain command placed after the mock invocation.  The
container script runs under `bash -exc`, and mock's failure branch does
`exit 1` INSIDE the `flock -c` string, so the flock command itself fails and
set -e aborts the script right there -- the restore never ran on the failure
path.

Two things broke as a result, one of them silently:

  * A SUCCESSFUL build whose results the host could not enumerate:
        find: /tmp/tmp.XXXXXX/results: Permission denied
        ERROR: No RPMs produced for xfce4-dev-tools
    This is the failure that put the command there originally.

  * The dnf5 already-installed retry (see test_mock_dynamic_br_retry.py) greps
    results/root.log to decide whether to retry.  On a file it cannot read,
    `grep -qs` fails SILENTLY -- the -s is there to swallow exactly that -- so
    the guard fell through to `return 1` and the retry never fired.  Canary run
    31242725235 came back built=24 failed=8, bit-identical to the baseline the
    fix was supposed to move.  Traced directly in that log: the restore appears
    in the set -x output for pytz and rust-matugen, both of which built, and is
    absent for python-wcwidth, which failed.

So the property under test is not "a chown exists somewhere" -- it did, and it
was unreachable.  It is that the restore survives an early exit.

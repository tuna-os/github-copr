"""The mock dynamic-BuildRequires retry in scripts/build-chain.sh.

mock 6.7 + dnf5 5.4.2.1: mock's dynamic-BuildRequires loop (backend.py
rebuild_package -> installSrpmDeps -> pkg_manager.builddep) runs dnf5 builddep
on the generated .buildreqs.nosrc.rpm.  When %generate_buildrequires emits
requirements the base buildroot ALREADY satisfies, dnf5 fails the whole
transaction with `Failed to resolve the transaction: Package "<nevra>" is
already installed.` and mock raises BuildError -- with nothing actually wrong
with the package.

Measured across all five parallel desktop runs: niri-00 (31231968581) 70
occurrences over 11 distinct packages, kde-00 (31215339645) 31, gnome-00
(31215535607) 25, xfce (31215533814) 4 -- and no other error shape in three of
the four (kde's zimg has a genuine stale patch).  36 of the 37 "package
failures" were one toolchain bug.

The retry cannot be exercised for real without privileged mock, so these drive
the extracted control flow with the container call stubbed.  That is the part
a mistake would break: retrying unconditionally would mask real dependency
errors, and not retrying at all would leave the bug in place.

"""A reusable workflow cannot request more permission than its caller grants.

GitHub rejects the CALLER's whole file when it does, and the message names
the callee:

    Invalid workflow file: .github/workflows/package-factory.yml#L144
    Error calling workflow '.../package-factory-cell.yml@966d9aa'. The
    workflow is requesting 'actions: read', but is only allowed 'actions: none'

This is not a failed run. It is a file that never parses, so nothing plans,
no job appears, and a merge queue has no required workflow to evaluate. It
cost hours of a session on a PR that read `blocked` with every visible check
green and no explanation anywhere in the UI -- and the diagnosis offered
twice was that the merge queue needed a human, which was wrong.

The cause was adding `actions: read` to package-factory-cell.yml so a
timed-out build chain could read its own previous artifacts (#480), without
adding it to package-factory.yml, which calls it.

Nothing else catches this. actionlint does not resolve local `uses:` targets,
yaml lint sees two valid documents, and every other test in this suite reads
one file at a time. The invariant is a RELATION between two files, so it
needs a test that holds both.

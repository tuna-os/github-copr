"""Every package in a chain must reuse one mock root cache, not rebuild it.

docs/hummingbird-throughput.md Finding 2 counted the cost across five real
runs: `Start: creating root cache` once per package, `unpacking root cache`
zero times, and the 43 s floor paid 194 times -- 2.32 h of 6.80 h, 34.1% of
all mock time spent rebuilding the same minimal buildroot.

build-chain.sh has been able to fix that since #277, and the fix went inert
without a word: it only mounts the cache when MOCK_CACHE_DIR is set, and the
workflow that set it was removed with the rest of the hummingbird-specific
pipeline (6d4b77a, #517).  package-factory-cell.yml, which replaced it, never
set it.  Nothing failed -- an unshared root cache is merely slow -- which is
exactly why it needs a test rather than a comment.

The failure modes pinned here are all silent ones:

  * an unset MOCK_CACHE_DIR: no mount, no sharing, 34% back on the clock;
  * a mount at /var/cache/mock rather than <config>/root_cache: that also
    shares yum_cache, which accumulates every BuildRequires RPM the chain
    downloads.  The chain now runs 4.5 h and its partial output is what the
    continuation shards resume from, so filling the disk costs a night;
  * a mount path built from anything but the config's own `root`: mock keys
    the cache on config_opts['root'] (buildroot.py `shared_root_name`), so a
    mismatch mounts a directory mock never looks at and says nothing.

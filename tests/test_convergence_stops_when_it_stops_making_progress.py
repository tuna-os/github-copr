"""A loop that cannot tell "still working" from "stuck" burns runners forever
— and one that measures the wrong thing burns them on the wrong packages.

scripts/plan-converge.py decides whether a convergence dispatches another
wave. What it decides on is NOT a count over the build order. Measured against
the live hummingbird index on 2026-08-28, the same repo on the same day reads:

    build order          580/673   (86%)
    desktop contract       3/10

A loop optimising the first number spends waves on vdirsyncer and hplip while
gdm and gnome-shell are absent — every one of them moves 580/673 upward and
moves the stack not at all. So the objective is scripts/stack_readiness.py's
ordered stages, and only the FIRST OPEN one decides anything.

The ways that goes wrong:

  WRONG NUMBER    judging on the whole order, or on a later stage moving while
                  the open one stands still. Both read as progress; neither is
                  progress toward a desktop that comes up.
  NEVER STOPS     the open stage not moving must end the loop.
  STOPS TOO SOON  a first wave has no previous count; reading a missing one as
                  zero ends the loop before it starts.
  FALSE READY     `packages-ready` ends the loop and green-lights an image
                  build, so it must never be reached from an index that could
                  not be read.
  OVERCLAIM       `packages-ready` must not be spelled `done`. Nothing here
                  proves a desktop boots; tunaOS's green-criteria Gate does.

"""%check's BuildRequires: are dropped with %check, in scripts/build-chain.sh.

Without --with-checks the build passes --nocheck, so %check never runs -- but
until this was added its BuildRequires: were still installed.  Fedora guards
them behind a bcond, and for a bootstrap buildroot the guarded lines are the
expensive ones:

    python-flit-core    %bcond tests -> python3-pytest, python3-testpath
    python-poetry-core  %bcond tests -> python3-pytest-mock, python3-virtualenv,
                                        python3-build, python3-tomli-w, ...

Those exist only in Rawhide, built for Python 3.15, while Hummingbird is on
3.14, so dnf5 could not resolve the buildroot at all and the build died before
rpmbuild started (run 31262874931, both packages of tier bootstrap-00):

    package python3-testpath-0.6.0-27.fc45.noarch from fedora requires
    python(abi) = 3.15, but none of the providers can be installed

The arguments have to reach two places for that to hold: the SRPM build,
because that header is what mock's `dnf builddep` reads, and mock itself, so
the dynamic-BuildRequires pass inside the chroot agrees with the header.  A
fix present in only one of the two looks right and changes nothing.

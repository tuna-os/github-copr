"""A request is answered by the contract, not by the resolver's own opinions.

`scripts/build_request.py` turns "gnome 51 on hummingbird" into the coordinates
a wave needs. Everything it returns must come out of
manifests/package-factory.yaml, the roots manifest that contract names, and
manifests/package-builds.yaml -- because the moment any of it is hard-coded
here, adding a target becomes a code change and the resolver becomes a second,
drifting definition of what a target is. That is the exact defect
scripts/factory_contract.py exists to prevent on the other side of the same
manifests.

The wrong answers pinned here are the quiet ones:

  WRONG CELLS   el10 carries gnome50, gnome51, xfce and fprintd on ONE target.
                An unfiltered cell list makes "gnome 51 on el10" dispatch
                xfce and fprintd -- work nobody asked for, on runners the
                request was meant to spend elsewhere.
  INVENTED MOVE a target with no roots manifest declares no release, so there
                is nothing to move FROM. Reporting a move there would offer
                `--adopt` on six declarations that do not exist.
  SILENT GAP    el10 has no gap_measurement, so its build order is curated by
                hand and cannot be regenerated. Answering the request as
                though it could is how a request quietly measures nothing.

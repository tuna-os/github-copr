"""Regenerating a build order must not move a package to a different spec dir.

The gap engine picks each package's spec directory by walking the roots
manifest's `source_paths:` in order and taking the first prefix that has a
directory of that name (scripts/gap_engine.py, `locate`). So `source_paths`
is the only thing deciding which GNOME track hummingbird builds -- and it is
NOT the file anyone edits when they repoint a track.

Measured on 2026-08-26, before this test existed:

    build-order-hummingbird-desktops.yml   19 packages from src/gnome-51/
    manifests/hummingbird-desktops.yaml    source_paths: [src/gnome-50, ...]

#521 repointed the build order to src/gnome-51 and updated the CELL's
source_paths in manifests/package-builds.yaml, which is what keys the cache.
It did not update the roots manifest, which is what regenerates the order.
Both files are named `source_paths` and they are different keys.

The consequence is not a red build. hummingbird's drift mode is `propose`
(manifests/package-factory.yaml): a scheduled job regenerates the order when
the live target index moves and opens a PR. That PR would have carried
gdm, gnome-shell, mutter, gtk4, libadwaita and 14 more from src/gnome-51
back to src/gnome-50 -- a silent downgrade of the whole desktop, arriving
under a title about re-measuring the gap.

The property is a fixpoint: for every `path:` the checked-in order already
names, resolving that name through the roots manifest must return that same
path. Anything else means a regeneration would rewrite the file.

"""Pin the dual-maintained hummingbird specs to their Tideforge recipes.

Seven packages exist twice while the native EL10 pipeline and Tideforge run
in parallel (docs/PACKAGE_FACTORY.md): a hand-written spec under
src/hummingbird/<p>/ and a recipe under packages/<p>/. Nothing kept the two
at the same upstream release, so a version bump could land on one side and
silently leave the other stale -- the exact single-source failure Tideforge
exists to remove. Until the legacy pipeline retires, this file makes the two
systems disagree loudly instead of drifting quietly.

Version and source URL only: dependency and packaging divergence between the
spec and the renderer is expected while both pipelines exist.

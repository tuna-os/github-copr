"""A wedged mock build must fail visibly, not hold the tier hostage.

Runs 31732589290 and 31757583258 each sat 2+ hours with ZERO further log
output after netcdf's builddep retry entered mock chroot init. The runner
agent stayed healthy the whole time -- it was the podman container that
never returned -- so GitHub's step timeout never fired, the workflow's
concurrency group stayed locked (queueing every later dispatch behind the
zombie), and both runs ended only when a human cancelled them.

An external timeout(1) around the container converts that hang into an
ordinary per-package failure (exit 124) that the existing tier-retry logic
skips past, the same external-bound pattern tunaOS#1572 applied to the
syft scan for the same reason: the process that hangs cannot be the one
enforcing its own deadline.

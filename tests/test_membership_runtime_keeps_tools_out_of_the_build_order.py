"""`membership: runtime` builds what images ship; tools stay in the buildroot.

The fold fix (#289) revealed that the true self-hosting closure of the five
desktops is 3282 source packages against a runtime closure of 663 -- a 5x
factory spent on bison, transfig, gtk-doc and the Java stack the documentation
toolchains drag in, none of which any image ships.  The committed 1248-package
order was neither closure: it was whatever the buggy fold happened to reach.

The decision (2026-08-17): the build order contains the runtime closure only,
and BuildRequires-only tools come from the buildroot's inherited Rawhide
fallback at priority 99.  Membership and ordering stay separate questions --
ordering always uses the real BuildRequires: graph, so members that
build-depend on each other still come up in the right tiers.

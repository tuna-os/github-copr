"""The fan-out must build everything exactly once, and publish like one.

Three layers, three failure modes:

  * the PLANNER must cover the whole order with disjoint shards -- a package
    dealt twice builds twice (wasted runner), a package dealt never silently
    falls out of the repo;
  * the CHAIN must treat filters and served-NVRs as opt-in -- the
    single-runner publisher passes neither and must behave exactly as before;
  * the WORKFLOWS must keep the one-publisher invariant -- the fanout's
    publish job rides the same `publish-rpms` concurrency group as every
    other publisher, and only ONE collector writes each band's cumulative
    artifact.

"""Moving a release track is six edits, and missing one is silent.

`src/gnome-51` is named in eight tracked files. Four are paths to the source
tree, one is a two-track table, three are prose recording history. A request
for "gnome 52 on hummingbird" has to move the first four together, report the
fifth, and leave the last three alone.

Why the silence matters more than the count. manifests/package-builds.yaml
carries the cell's `source_paths`, and its own comments record what happens
when one is missing:

    src/gnome-51/ is here because build-order-hummingbird-desktops.yml pulls
    19 packages from it ... Without the path listed, an edit to any of those
    specs does not move this cell's action key, so the cache restores an
    ActionResult built from the OLD spec and the change is silently ignored.

So a partial move does not fail. It builds, it goes green, and it ships the
previous release. The test that matters is therefore not "does adopt work" but
"can a file that names a track exist WITHOUT being classified" -- because that
is the only way the table goes stale, and a stale table is a partial move.

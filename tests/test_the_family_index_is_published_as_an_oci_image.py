"""Every published build-chain family index is also an OCI image, by digest.

Maintainer directive, 2026-09-03: no more COPR -- build in GitHub like
projectbluefin/utah-packages (#673). The building half was already true: the
GNOME 50 tier is made by package-factory.yml in a CentOS Stream 10 mock root.
What utah-packages adds is how the result is CONSUMED: an OCI image whose
only content is the createrepo output, pinned by digest, bind-mounted into
the consumer's build. tunaOS already consumes utah-packages that way for
hummingbird:gnome; these tests pin that this publisher gives tunaOS the same
handle for EL10.

The properties, each with the reason it is not optional:

  same bytes      The image is built from `repo/` AFTER the R2 sync-up, so
                  the digest and https://repo.tunaos.org/<r2_path>/ name one
                  index. Publishing before the sync (or from `staged/`)
                  would let the two drift on the first partial failure.
  one tag per     The tag is the cell id (gnome50-el10-x86_64): one image
  cell            per family and architecture, never a shared `latest` that
                  a second family could overwrite.
  no dry-run push A dry run must not publish anything, in either channel.
  signed          cosign, keyless, over the digest -- which is why the job
                  needs id-token: write, and packages: write for the push.

"""What we publish for Hummingbird must resolve on Hummingbird, and CI must say so.

scripts/check-hummingbird-installability.py is the static half of the gate
utah-packages runs inside the bootc-os image before it publishes: with only
the target's repository and our published prefix, does every desktop root
resolve?  Measured 2026-09-02 on the live x86_64 indexes, no desktop did --
GNOME had 30 unresolved capabilities, three of them libm.so.6(GLIBC_2.44)
from packages this factory built in a Rawhide root.  The chain had been
reporting those packages as built for weeks.

These tests drive the checker with synthetic indexes so its verdict logic is
pinned without the network, and hold that the scheduled workflow runs it.

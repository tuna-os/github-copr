"""One level of tooling support per declared format — enforced, not hoped.

The factory ships desktops for RPM, DEB, and pacman targets as equals
(RFC 011); its checks and records must be equals too, or the tooling
quietly becomes an EL-focused factory with some extra targets attached.
This ledger asserts, per format the contract declares, that the
capabilities exist and are wired. Adding a format — or a capability —
without its counterparts turns this file red, which is the review
conversation happening in CI instead of in an incident.

Known, deliberate asymmetries are pinned as such below, with the reason
they are asymmetric, so they read as decisions rather than drift.

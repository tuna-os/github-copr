"""Coverage has to see the subprocesses the tests actually drive.

Most scripts here are tested the way CI runs them -- as a subprocess:

    subprocess.run([sys.executable, str(PLANNER), "--packages", "evtest"])

A subprocess is a fresh interpreter, so without coverage's process-startup
hook the parent measures nothing of it. Measured on 6a3e0f2b, same suite, same
command, the only difference being whether COVERAGE_PROCESS_START was set:

    scripts/plan-chain-shards.py             0% -> 97%
    scripts/hummingbird-desktop-roots.py     0% -> 97%
    scripts/plan-deb-publish.py              0% -> 87%
    scripts/plan-arch-publish.py             0% -> 81%
    scripts/parse-build-order.py             0% -> 70%
    repo total                              59% -> 67%

The difference is not cosmetic. 0% is the signal that sends someone to write
tests that already exist, and it is the number a coverage floor would be
judged against -- a floor picked from the blind figure sits 8 points low.

`.coveragerc` (this commit) is the half that can live in the tree. The other
half is one `env:` line in the Python Tests job, which needs the `workflows`
permission to push; it is written out in the issue for a maintainer to apply.
The tests below therefore split in two:

  * unconditional -- `.coveragerc` asks for parallel data files, and this
    interpreter honours COVERAGE_PROCESS_START at all (that is coverage's
    `.pth` file, easy to lose to a packaging change and silent when lost);
  * conditional -- the moment the job runs with `--cov`, it must also export
    the variable and install the plugin, and any floor it enforces must be the
    number codecov.yml declares. Until then those skip, saying why.

A conditional test is not a placeholder: it is the guard that catches someone
turning coverage on and getting the blind number.

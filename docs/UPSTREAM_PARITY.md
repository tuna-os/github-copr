# Upstream parity register

TunaOS ships desktop experiences curated by the Bluefin, Aurora, and Zirconium
communities.  Parity therefore means their deliberately selected applications,
defaults, session behavior, hardware integration, and update/store experience
are carried forward—not merely that similarly named programs are installed.
This is a compatibility target, not permission to consume another project's
binary repositories or image filesystem. Every item below must be provided by
the target distribution, rebuilt by TunaOS, or explicitly marked out of scope.

The audit was taken from the following upstream revisions on 2026-07-25:

| Upstream | Revision | Scope |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Zirconium](https://github.com/zirconium-dev/zirconium) | `c43b53abfb75296f8517990823fd2cc9f095d837` | Niri/DMS desktop and session integration |
| [Bluefin](https://github.com/ublue-os/bluefin) | `742b3b77b924aeff47610b6c985dd1805dd5e927` | GNOME workstation utilities and update experience |
| [Aurora](https://github.com/ublue-os/aurora) | `6dd632ebefd04bacc4eba0319f3106e739417cc0` | KDE workstation utilities and update experience |

## Rules

1. A TunaOS image must not enable a COPR, PPA, or upstream binary repository.
2. Fedora, EPEL, CentOS Stream, Ubuntu, and Debian packages remain preferred
   when their version meets the experience requirement.
3. When upstream does not provide a suitable package, TunaOS imports source
   with a pinned revision/checksum, license review, SBOM/provenance, native
   RPM/DEB packaging, and target install/runtime gates.
4. Curated configuration is maintained in TunaOS with upstream provenance and
   attribution. It is never copied opaquely from an upstream image at build
   time; reviewed files are imported as source, tested, and maintained here.

## Initial parity inventory

| Experience | Current upstream-only gap | Factory disposition | Gate before promotion |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Niri compositor | `niri` currently comes from `yalter/niri-git` | Source RPM now builds and clean-installs on EL10 with Tideforge `libseat` and upstream session/portal assets; retain user-session validation before promotion | Ubuntu/Debian install; Wayland session smoke test |
| DMS shell | `quickshell-git`, `dms`, `dms-cli`, `dms-greeter` come from AvengeMedia COPRs | Source recipes are present. Quickshell and the full DMS/greetd closure build and clean-install on EL10 from staged Tideforge RPMs; retain user-session/login validation before promotion | greetd login and DMS user-session smoke test |
| COSMIC session | COSMIC's session manager, compositor, portal, settings, and greeter use vendor archives plus nonstandard install contracts | Tideforge models pinned sources, offline Cargo vendor configurations, native install contracts, and the two EL10 greeter patches for the complete root set. The icon themes, session manager, background manager, compositor, idle manager, notification daemon, on-screen display service, panel/dock, settings app, settings daemon, and display tool have real EL10 builds and staged-install proof; their generated RPM payloads are CI-gated. The remaining COSMIC runtime packages must still be staged as a complete release set before promotion. | COSMIC login/session smoke |
| Niri sensors | Zirconium's `iio-niri` needs hardware-specific validation | Source RPM builds and clean-installs on EL10 against the Tideforge Niri stack; do not promote until its rotation behavior is tested | accelerometer service and rotation smoke test on hardware-capable runner |
| Niri companion tools | Zirconium includes `dgop`, `dsearch` (now upstream `danksearch`), and `dankcalendar-git`; legacy TunaOS also references `valent-git` | `dgop` and `danksearch` build and clean-install on EL10 from source. Dank Calendar now has an Arch Tideforge source recipe using the upstream tagged archive with vendored modules and bundled DankCommon; EL10/DEB intake waits for a source-built Go 1.26 toolchain. A fresh EL10 repository probe confirms that `valent` is not stock content, so it remains an optional source-intake candidate rather than a target dependency. | package install plus application/service smoke test |
| Greeter integration | Zirconium owns greetd PAM, sysusers, tmpfiles, DMS policy, and session files; TunaOS currently copies portions from its image | Import the curated configuration with attribution into TunaOS and package generated helpers; priority 0 | `greetd` service, PAM, and Niri login e2e test |
| XFCE login | XFCE Wayland uses `gtkgreet` hosted by Cage for its graphical greetd login | Tideforge owns pinned `gtk-layer-shell` and `gtkgreet` recipes. `gtk-layer-shell` has an EL10 staged-install gate; `gtkgreet` promotion is gated by consuming its generated `-devel` RPM. Retain the native spec meanwhile. | `greetd` + Cage + `gtkgreet` login smoke |
| XFCE compositor | `xfwl4` needs a Cargo vendor tree and XFCE Wayland protocol submodule not present in the upstream archive | Tideforge now models both checksum-locked source inputs, including the exact offline Cargo replacement configuration. Native RPM remains the promoted path until the full Xfce prerequisite closure is staged and runtime-tested. | Xfce Wayland nested/TTY session smoke |
| Bluefin updates/store | `uupd` is the remaining Bluefin COPR package; Bazaar is version-dependent upstream/Fedora content | `uupd` has a factory recipe. Bazaar now has a pinned Tideforge source recipe for Ubuntu 26.04, Debian sid, and Arch; its EL10 enablement waits for the staged GNOME 50 library set because upstream requires GTK 4.22 and libadwaita 1.8. | update command contract and Flatpak-store launch test |
| Aurora KDE add-ons | `krunner-bazaar`, `oversteer-udev`, `kairpods`, `sunshine`, and Aurora's patched `plasma-setup` | Split into independently licensed source packages; do not import Aurora's COPR binaries. The EL10 probe confirms `sunshine` and `plasma-setup` are absent from stock repositories. Plasma Setup now has a pinned upstream KDE source recipe for the current Arch Plasma stack; EL10 waits for its latest-KDE staging repository. Sunshine needs a separate toolchain/bootstrap review before recipe intake. | EL10/KDE install and feature-specific runtime tests |
| Aurora SELinux workaround | Aurora's `ublue-os-selinux-workarounds` mitigates a Linux 7.0 composefs/overlay execmem regression | Do not ship on EL10: its source policy explicitly targets Linux 7.0 and grants `kernel_t` execmem; retain an evidence-based re-evaluation if the target kernel acquires that defect | Not applicable unless an EL10 reproducer exists |

The ordinary long Fedora package lists from Bluefin and Aurora are not factory
inputs.  TunaOS should compare them continuously, then consume the distribution
packages where available.  Rebuilding a Fedora package just to duplicate it
would increase maintenance without improving parity.

## Snapshot audit (#226)

`_upstream-snapshots/` holds the package declarations this register tracks —
one YAML per upstream (`bluefin-lts`, `aurora`, `zirconium`), keyed to the
upstream revisions in the table above and scoped to the curated parity-relevant
packages rather than the ordinary Fedora lists.  Each declaration carries the
disposition TunaOS intends: a source recipe, a desktop-manifest declaration, a
named distribution package, or an explicit out-of-scope entry with a reason.
`scripts/audit-upstream-parity.py` verifies the repository honours it:

```
scripts/audit-upstream-parity.py --strict
scripts/audit-upstream-parity.py --report-json docs/upstream-parity-report.json
```

Any snapshot package with no disposition — or a disposition the repository
does not honour (a declared recipe with no `packages/<name>`/`src/*/<name>`,
an out-of-scope entry with no reason) — is an uncovered gap and fails
`--strict`.  `tests/test_upstream_parity_audit.py` asserts the committed
snapshots stay covered, so a recipe rename or removal without a snapshot
update is caught in CI.

The register's remaining recommendation — extracting the full installed
package list of every published edition image on every release tag and
failing any image with fewer packages than its base — needs container-registry
access and belongs to the image-build pipeline; this repository's contribution
is the recipe-side half of the contract (rules 1–4 and the inventory table).

## Delivery order

1. Replace the Niri/DMS COPR chain and upstream-image payload with source-built
   packages and TunaOS-owned configuration.
2. Replace the COSMIC and GNOME release-gated RPM dependencies already in the
   factory plan.
3. Close Bluefin's `uupd` and Aurora's KDE add-on gaps one package at a time.
4. Add a parity CI job which checks the curated selection and behavior in every
   table entry against Fedora, EL10, Ubuntu, and Debian availability, and fails
   if a new external repository or opaque upstream image copy is introduced.

An intake entry is not a release promise: it becomes supported only after the
source provenance, license, native package build, staged-repository install,
and relevant desktop smoke tests are all green.

# The warm builder — a host that remembers

Bringing a desktop up on a new target is a loop of *build, hit a wall, fix one
spec, build again*. On CI that loop costs a wave: every leg runs on an
ephemeral runner, so the second attempt re-pays for every package the first one
built. The warm builder is the same chain on a host where three things survive
between attempts.

```
just warm-status hummingbird-x86_64      # what this host has banked
just warm hummingbird-x86_64             # build; skip everything already banked or served
just warm-forget hummingbird-x86_64 gtk4 # drop one source package's output
```

## What persists, and why each one matters

| Path under `<state>/<cell>/` | What it buys |
| --- | --- |
| `local-repo/` | `build-chain.sh` skips any package whose exact NVR is already there. This is what turns attempt 2 into "rebuild gtk4 and its dependents" instead of "rebuild 580 packages". |
| `mock-cache/<config>/root_cache` | mock unpacks the minimal buildroot instead of creating it. Measured at 34.1% of all mock time across five real runs (`docs/hummingbird-throughput.md`, Finding 2). |
| `served-nvrs.txt` | what the published index already carries, refreshed each run, so the warm host skips CI's progress too rather than duplicating it. |

None of this is new machinery. `build-chain.sh` has had the NVR skip and the
`MOCK_CACHE_DIR` mount for a long time; `package-factory-cell.yml` deliberately
points the cache at `runner.temp`, where the win is only *within* one job. The
warm builder points both at a volume that outlives the run.

## Provisioning a host

Anything that can run rootless podman with ~200 GB of disk. The pool in
`.github/runs-on.yml` is already sized for exactly this workload (16 vCPU →
`JOBS = nproc/2` → 8 parallel mock roots, 64 GB-class memory, 200 GB gp3), so
an equivalent VM is a reasonable target.

```bash
# Fedora / EL host
sudo dnf install -y podman createrepo_c rpm-build git-core just python3-pyyaml

# Ubuntu host
sudo apt-get install -y podman createrepo-c rpm git just python3-yaml
# Ubuntu 24.04 confines rootless podman's first clone(); the hosted images turn
# this off and the stock AMIs do not (#564).
sudo sysctl -w kernel.apparmor_restrict_unprivileged_userns=0

git clone https://github.com/tuna-os/tunaos-packages && cd tunaos-packages
export TUNAOS_WARM_STATE=/var/lib/tunaos-warm     # a persistent volume
just warm-status hummingbird-x86_64
```

Put `TUNAOS_WARM_STATE` on the largest persistent disk you have. A full
hummingbird chain banks several GB of RPMs plus the root cache.

## The loop

```bash
just warm hummingbird-x86_64                       # ~first run: the whole gap
# ... gtk4 fails on pango ...
$EDITOR src/gnome-51/pango/pango.spec
just warm-forget hummingbird-x86_64 gtk4           # drop gtk4's output
just warm-forget hummingbird-x86_64 pango
just warm hummingbird-x86_64                       # rebuilds only those two + dependents
```

`--forget` drops everything a *source package* produced — `gtk4`,
`gtk4-devel`, `gtk4-devel-docs` — and nothing that merely shares a prefix, so
`gtk4-layer-shell` survives. Getting either half wrong is silent: leaving
`gtk4-devel` behind means every dependent compiles against headers from the
build that failed, and taking `gtk4-layer-shell` turns a one-package retry back
into a chain.

Anything `build-chain.sh` understands rides through unchanged:

```bash
just warm hummingbird-x86_64 --tiers bootstrap-00,bootstrap-01
just warm hummingbird-x86_64 --package src/gnome-51/gtk4
just warm hummingbird-x86_64 --jobs 8
just warm hummingbird-x86_64 --dry-run
```

## What it is not

**It is not a publisher.** It never touches R2, never signs anything, and its
`local-repo/` is not a repository anyone consumes. Promotion stays with the
gated publishers, for the reasons `INCIDENT-repo-wipe-gnome.md` records — and
the point of the warm host is to get a chain green *fast*, then let CI build
and publish it from a clean runner, where the result is reproducible rather
than merely present.

**It is not a second definition of a cell.** The manifest, mock config, image
and served index all come from `manifests/package-builds.yaml` and
`manifests/package-factory.yaml`, never from flags. A warm builder with its own
idea of what a cell is would drift from the one CI uses, and the failure mode
of that drift is a green local build of something CI cannot reproduce.

## Using it as a self-hosted runner instead

The same state directories work if you register the host as a GitHub
self-hosted runner and set `MOCK_CACHE_DIR` and `--local-repo` to paths outside
the workspace. That gets the warm start on CI's side too, at the cost of a
long-lived machine holding repository credentials — a real trade, and one to
make deliberately rather than by drifting into it. The ephemeral RunsOn pool in
`.github/runs-on.yml` is the alternative: cold, but disposable.

See `docs/rfc/rfc012-request-driven-convergence.md` for how this fits the
request → converge → blocker loop.

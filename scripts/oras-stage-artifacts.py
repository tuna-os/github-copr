"""Stage build-chain RPM artifacts in ORAS so independent builds don't race the publish repo.

publish-build-chain-rpms.yml's `rclone sync` into R2 must be serialized --
two of them running at once can delete each other's packages (#124 /
INCIDENT-repo-wipe-gnome), which is why that workflow's concurrency group
allows only one publisher at a time. Building has no such constraint: many
independent package builds (a nightly run, a one-off dispatch for a single
missing package, a manual retry) can run concurrently without conflict, as
long as they don't all try to be the one process that syncs to R2.

This module is the middle layer that lets them not have to be. Every build
job pushes its own successfully-built RPMs here, as independent ORAS
artifacts on ghcr.io -- concurrent pushes of different tags don't race each
other the way `rclone sync` does. The single serialized publish job then
pulls everything currently staged before its normal createrepo+sync, so
publishing itself is exactly as serialized as before; only the building
that feeds it is free to fan out.

push <dir>: push every *.rpm in <dir> to the shared ORAS repo, tagged by a
sanitized NVR. RPM release fields can carry `~` (prerelease, e.g. 51~beta)
and `^` (snapshot/post-release), neither of which is a valid OCI tag
character -- collapsed to `_` here. Nothing is actually lost by that: the
pushed file keeps its real name via ORAS's own title annotation regardless
of what the tag looks like, and the tag only needs to be unique and valid,
not reversible. (Two distinct RPM names collapsing to the identical
sanitized tag is possible in principle -- it would need two builds to
differ ONLY in a character this collapses, in the same position -- but
that is not a pattern real RPM naming produces, and see the module
docstring's incident note for why the collision that actually matters,
concurrent *publish*, is guarded elsewhere.)

pull-all <dir>: list every tag currently staged and pull each one into
<dir>, restoring original filenames. Best-effort per tag: one vanished or
corrupt entry must not stop the publish job from picking up everything
else that's staged.

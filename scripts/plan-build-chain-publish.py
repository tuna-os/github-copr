"""Resolve build-chain cells for publishing, and refuse the unsafe ones.

The build-chain families each declare an `r2_path` in the catalog, so where a
cell publishes is data rather than something this workflow invents. What the
data does NOT settle is whether that destination is safe to sync into, and
two of the answers are "no".

DESTINATION COLLISION. publish-tideforge-rpms.yml syncs x86_64 to
`repo/10-stream-x86_64` and then mirrors the same tree to `repo/10-x86_64`:

    rclone sync repo/ "r2:${R2_BUCKET}/repo/10-x86_64/"

`gnome50-el10-x86_64` declares exactly that path. `rclone sync` makes the
destination match the source, so publishing gnome50 there means the next
tideforge publish deletes every gnome50 package, and this publish deletes
every tideforge package in between. Serialising the two workflows (the shared
concurrency group) stops them racing; it does not stop them overwriting.

That is a catalog question -- either gnome50 wants its own prefix, or the
mirror wants to be a union rather than a copy -- and it is not one to guess
at while holding credentials that can empty a live repo. So it is refused
here by name, loudly, with the reason.

NO DESTINATION. A cell with an empty `r2_path`, or `publish: false`, is
declaring it has nowhere to go. `fprintd-el10-x86_64` is both.

# Sign, place and index one wave of RPMs into a local repo tree.
#
# This is the half of publishing that is pure file manipulation: no network,
# no secrets, no rclone. The caller syncs the destination down first, calls
# this, then syncs up. Splitting it out is not tidiness -- publish-tideforge
# -rpms.yml and publish-build-chain-rpms.yml both need it, and every safety
# rule below was learned once and must not have to be learned again in the
# second copy. The repo has already paid for that kind of drift twice (the
# nightly cron stagger documented but never applied; the readiness stamp read
# from two paths flatpak had stopped using).
#
# The rules, each anchored to the incident that produced it:
#
#   EMPTY WAVE      A wave with no RPMs means the build produced nothing and
#                   the publish is a no-op that would still rewrite repodata.
#                   Refuse, so a silently-empty build cannot look published.
#
#   NEVER SHRINK    #124 / INCIDENT-repo-wipe-gnome: `rclone sync` makes the
#                   destination match the source, so a locally-incomplete
#                   tree DELETES the served repo. The caller guards the
#                   sync-down; this guards the processing. Publishing adds
#                   packages -- if the tree came out smaller than it came in,
#                   something dropped files and syncing up would erase them
#                   from the bucket.
#
#   '+' IN NAMES    librepo percent-encodes '+' when building download URLs,
#                   but the repo.tunaos.org worker looks up R2 keys with the
#                   raw request path, so any filename containing '+' 404s at
#                   install time (run 32411090239: oversteer-udev-0.8.3+git…
#                   serves 200 at the literal-'+' URL and 404 at the %2b
#                   one). Renamed across the WHOLE tree, not just the staged
#                   files, so the sync also replaces any '+'-named object
#                   already in the bucket. Only the file name changes; the
#                   version inside the rpm metadata is untouched.
#
#   SRPMS EXCLUDED  Source RPMs are not installable content and bloat the
#                   index; the tideforge publisher has always excluded them.
#
#   SUPERSEDE       A publisher writes into REPO/SUBDIR, but the prefixes it
#                   writes to were served for months by earlier publishers
#                   that wrote flat at the root. Copying in leaves BOTH, and
#                   an rpm-md index with two entries for one NEVRA is
#                   ambiguous: dnf picks one, and the two are not the same
#                   bytes -- measured on xfce/10-stream-x86_64, which held
#                   107 same-NEVRA pairs with 107 differing checksums after
#                   the first build-chain wave. The staged copy is the
#                   freshly signed one, so it wins and the older file with
#                   the same name is removed from anywhere else in the tree.
#                   Subtracted from the NEVER SHRINK baseline, since this is
#                   the one shrink that is intended.
#
#   FOREIGN CONTENT A family prefix carries what this factory built and
#   (--evict-foreign) signed, and nothing else. gnome50/10-stream-x86_64 was
#                   filled on 2026-08-04 by the since-deleted
#                   refresh-gnome50-r2.yml, which downloaded the
#                   jreilly1821/c10s-gnome-50 COPR and synced it in: 466
#                   package names signed by the COPR project key
#                   (99b9f29ec528e021), not the publisher's. A consumer
#                   with gpgcheck=1 and the publisher's public.gpg fails on
#                   every one of them -- tunaOS run 33750514082: 'GPG check
#                   FAILED, Public key for glib2-2.88.0-4.el10.x86_64.rpm
#                   is not installed'. And the maintainer's directive
#                   (2026-09-03) is no more COPR: build in GitHub. So an
#                   RPM in the synced-down tree whose header signature is
#                   not by the publisher's key (any subkey of %_gpg_name)
#                   is evicted before indexing, and the sync-up deletes it
#                   from the bucket. Opt-in per publisher: the build-chain
#                   publisher owns its family prefixes outright; the
#                   tideforge publisher writes into repo/10-stream-x86_64,
#                   which has more history than one key, and does not ask.
#                   Guarded: the freshly signed staged RPMs must be
#                   recognised as the publisher's own before anything is
#                   evicted -- a key-id derivation that fails that check
#                   would otherwise evict the whole tree, which is #124 by
#                   another road.
